<Callout>
  This feature is available to users on our [Pro plan](https://buildstash.com/pricing) and up.
</Callout>

## Introduction

While Buildstash offers simple, low-cost storage for your builds out the box, you may prefer to host your own build data.

We provide documented support for [AWS S3](/integrations/storage/aws-s3) and [Cloudflare R2](/integrations/storage/cloudflare-r2), however in theory you can connect any S3-API compatible storage provider.

<Callout>
  Using providers other than AWS or Cloudflare is not officially supported at this time, and it is possible you may encounter issues.

## Configuration

If you haven't already created a storage bucket to use with Buildstash, it is strongly advised to start with a new or empty bucket. Our application expects a certain directory structure and won't be able to work with existing files.

<ImageZoom

  height={800}
  sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
/>

You will need to configure the bucket region if it has one specified. For non-AWS providers, this is often just 'auto'.

Most importantly, you will have to enter the custom endpoint for the bucket - excluding the bucket name itself.
