## Create API token

To upload builds using this CI integration you'll need to [create an application specific API token, via the standard steps](/builds-and-releases/connect-ci-cd).

## Add Buildstash action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Buildstash action">
    <strong>Install Buildstash action</strong>

    Go to the [Buildstash action page on the GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/buildstash).

    ![GitHub Marketplace page](https://media.buildstash.com/docs/integrations/github-actions/b6d3c278cf06f5f5eeade74fd594669a.png)

    You can copy and paste the provided code into your workflow yaml script.
  </Step>
  <br />
  <Step title="Add API key to your 'Actions secrets' for the repository">
    <strong>Add API key to your 'Actions secrets' for the repository</strong>

    Take the Buildstash application API key you [previously created](/builds-and-releases/connect-ci-cd), and store it as a "Actions" secret.

    ![GitHub Actions secrets](https://media.buildstash.com/docs/integrations/github-actions/d3ec2c4bb243e04e51b0223f3d7db87a.png)

    Note, as you'll be using an application-specific Buildstash API key (required to upload builds for particular app) you likely want to store this secret on your GitHub repository level, rather than workspace.
  </Step>
  <br />
  <Step title="Tweak input values accordingly">
    <strong>Tweak input values accordingly</strong>

    Update the action inputs to pass in your project and run specific values.
    See "Inputs" table below for more detail.
  </Step>
  <br />
  <Step title="See your builds appear in Buildstash!">
    <strong>See your builds appear in Buildstash!</strong>

    Successful GitHub Actions runs will now be sending your builds into Buildstash. Welcome to artifact management actually designed for apps.
