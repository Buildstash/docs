## Introduction
iOS and Android developers using fastlane in their build workflows for automating steps like code signing and deployment to stores, can now use a Buildstash plugin to upload .ipas, .apks, and .aabs direct to Buildstash.

Teams can then take advantage of Buildstash features like distribution groups as an alternative faster method for sharing builds with testers and collaborators - with you in control.

## Create API token

To upload builds using fastlane you'll need to [create an application specific API token](/builds-and-releases/connect-ci-cd).

## Install fastlane plugin

You can simply install the Buildstash fastlane plugin with:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin buildstash
```

## Usage

For full documentation on use of the plugin within your fastlane workflow, including a full list of inputs and outputs, go to the [GitHub repository and see the readme](https://github.com/buildstash/fastlane-plugin-buildstash).
