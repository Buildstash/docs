## Introduction

It's easy to upload build artifacts from your GitLab pipelines to Buildstash, allowing you to easily manage all your built binaries, share with your team, and distribute to users in the one platform.

## Create API token

To upload builds using GitLab you'll need to [create an application specific API token](/builds-and-releases/connect-ci-cd).

## Buildstash components

You can find the Buildstash components for GitLab in the [GitLab CI/CD Catalog](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/buildstash/buildstash-gitlab-components).

## Usage

The [readme](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/buildstash/buildstash-gitlab-components) includes extensive documentation on setting up the component to upload to Buildstash in your workflow, and using its outputs elsewhere in your pipeline.
