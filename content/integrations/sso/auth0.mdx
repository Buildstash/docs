## Introduction

Follow these instructions to allow your users to login to your Buildstash workspace using Auth0.

## Create SSO Application in Auth0

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create new application">
    <strong>Create new application</strong>

    In your Auth0 dashboard, navigate to "Applications", and "Create new application".

      height={800}
      sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />

    Select "Regular Web Application".

  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete application details">
    <strong>Complete application details</strong>

    There are some key details to enter for your new application.

    Under "Application URIs" you must enter your workspace-specific redirect URI under "Allowed Callback URIs". You can find this in the "Enable provider" dialog covered below, but it follows the format:
    `https://{SUBDOMAIN}.buildstash.com/auth/auth0/callback`

      sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Login Experience to Individuals">
    <strong>Set Login Experience to "Individuals"</strong>

    Configure the login experience settings for your application.

      height={800}
      sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant users access">
    <strong>Grant users access</strong>

    Remember and grant access to whatever users you'd like. In "User Management" select a user profile, and in "Authorized Applications" grant access to Buildstash.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Note client ID and secret">
    <strong>Note client ID and secret</strong>

    Now you're setup in Auth0. You'll need the client ID and secret from your application settings to enter into Buildstash.

    />

  </Step>

</Steps>


## Configure SSO in Buildstash

<Steps>

  <Step title="Enable SSO provider">
    <strong>Enable SSO provider</strong>

    Go to your workspace settings, and under "Enterprise SSO", select "Enable provider".

    <ImageZoom
      src="https://media.buildstash.com/docs/integrations/auth0/05_enable.png"
      alt="Enable SSO provider"
      width={550}
      height={800}
      sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Input provider credentials">
    <strong>Input provider credentials</strong>

    Input the client ID and secret you copied noted from the previous step. Your redirect URI to enter in Auth0 is also shown here.

    You'll also need to input your Tenant Domain. This consists of the name of your Auth0 tenant, and for non-US locations will also include a region component (like 'eu' for European Union, or 'ca' for Canada).

    <ImageZoom
      src="https://media.buildstash.com/docs/integrations/auth0/06_configure.png"
      alt="Input provider credentials"
      width={550}
      height={800}
      sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm correctly configured">
    <strong>Confirm correctly configured</strong>

    Once details are entered and confirmed you'll see Auth0 connected.

    <ImageZoom
      src="https://media.buildstash.com/docs/integrations/auth0/07_sucess.png"
      alt="Confirm correctly configured"
      width={550}
      height={800}
      sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />
    
    Select "Manage" to update credentials in future, disable non-SSO login, or remove Auth0 as a login provider in future.

    <ImageZoom
      src="https://media.buildstash.com/docs/integrations/auth0/08_manage.png"
      alt="Manage SSO settings"
      width={550}
      height={800}
      sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
    />

    You can optionally require users login via this SSO provider to access your workspace, and there's an option to auto-add users who login via this provider to your workspace if they're not already a member.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Login with SSO">
    <strong>Login with SSO</strong>

    You can now navigate to the login page on your workspace custom subdomain, and the Auth0 SSO option will be presented.

  </Step>
