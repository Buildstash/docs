## Introduction

You can configure an email notification automation to notify members of your workspace, or an external email address, of application events.

See the [automations overview](/automations) for more detail on events you can subscribe to.

## Setup automated email notifications

You can configure email notifications on a per-application basis. Go to your application _Settings > Automations_.

<ImageZoom

  alt="Email notifications"
  width={550}
  height={800}
  sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
/>

Click "Manage" to list existing automations, and add new ones. You can configure up to 10 email automations per application.

To configure a new email notification - select [the event](/automations) you'd like to subscribe to, and who you'd like to be notified.

You can either notify a list of workspace members (search for them by name or email), or an external email address (for example you may wish to inform a mailing list such as _developers@company.example_ or _testers@company.example_).
