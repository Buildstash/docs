## Introduction

You can trigger Slack notifications in response to key events in Buildstash, such as uploading a new build, or creating a release.

## Connect your Slack team

Before you can setup automated notifications, you need to connect your Slack team to your Buildstash workspace. To do so:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Go to your workspace settings, and select 'Connections' tab">
    <strong>Go to your workspace settings, and select "Connections" tab</strong>
    <br /><br />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your Slack team">
    <strong>"Connect" your Slack team</strong>

    You'll be directed to Slack to confirm the installation of the Buildstash app, and you can select a default channel to post notifications to (don't worry you can easily override this later).

    Note we limit the permissions we request to the minimum to allow us to:
    - Allow you to select which channel to post notifications to in Buildstash
    - Post to either a public channel, or a private channel you've specifically invited the Buildstash bot to
    - Respond to direct mentions of the Buildstash bot
  </Step>

  <Step title="Successfully connect team">
    <strong>Once connected successfully you'll see:</strong>

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Setup Slack automations for your apps

Next, you can setup automations which consist of an event trigger (when should we send a notification), and a target Slack channel (where should the notification be sent to).

Slack automations must be setup on a per-app basis. So remember and set this up for each app you want to automate Slack notifications for. Being per-app gives you the flexibility to post notifications to different Slack channels for different Buildstash apps, if you prefer.

To setup:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Select Automations tab">
    <strong>In your application settings, select the "Automations" tab</strong>
    <br /><br />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Manage Slack automations">
    <strong>Find the Slack section, and select "Manage"</strong>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add automation">
    <strong>Add your desired automations</strong>

    For each automation input:
    - What event in Buildstash should trigger the notification
    - Which Slack channel you'd like to send the notification to

    <Callout>
      Remember that the Buildstash bot can only see public Slack channels by default. If you'd like to post to a private Slack channel you'd have to first invite the Buildstash bot into that channel (within Slack), then you'll see the private channel as a selectable option in Buildstash for the automation.

    <strong>And done! Look out for your Buildstash notifications appearing in Slack 🎉</strong>
