## Sharing with your team

Workspace members can access builds and releases according to [their permissions](/workspace/permissions).

Every build and release has an internal share link attached, which can found under the "Sharing" tab in your build or release summary, and used as a quick shortcut to download the build or release.

/>

## Public share links

To quickly share a build or release with someone outside of your workspace, you can create a "public" share link.

You can have multiple share links per build or release, and each link can optionally be password protected, or have an expiry date set.

## Options for automated sharing and distribution

There are numerous other options for automating sharing of your builds, or for wider distribution:

- [Create an automation](/automations) to notify workspace members, a Slack channel, or webhook of new builds or releases
- Use [distribution groups](/distribution-groups) to publish releases to an email list
- Use [portals](/portals) to share build streams and/or releases via a branded interface you can host on your website
