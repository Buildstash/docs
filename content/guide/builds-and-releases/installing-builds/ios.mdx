## Introduction

Developers can use Buildstash to distribute ad-hoc and enterprise signed iOS builds directly to testers.

As a user, you may have an iOS app download shared with you from Buildstash via a [distribution group](/distribution-groups) email, [share link](/builds-and-releases/sharing), or [portal](/portals).

## Installing an app

To install an iOS app, you will need to open the download page the developer has shared with you in Safari on your iOS device.

<Callout>
  The installation will _only_ work in Safari, and if you attempt to open it in a different browser you should see a warning message directing you to open Safari.
</Callout>

Once the downloaded has completed, you will see a dialog to confirm the installation. Tap "Install" to continue.

If you haven't previously installed an app from this developer, you may have to "trust" with the developer in iOS Settings > General > VPN & Device Management. The Buildstash install flow will guide you through this.

## Troubleshooting

In case you encounter any issues installing an iOS app, there are a few common causes and solutions:

### “Untrusted Enterprise Developer” error

This is an enterprise signed app, and you haven't "trusted" the developer yet. You must trust the developer under "VPN & Device Management" following the steps above

### “Unable to Download App” error

This error may be prompted due to multiple reasons. You should rule out these causes, and then contact the app developer if issues persist:
- iOS version is not compatible with this build: you should see the supported iOS version on the download page
- Your device storage is full: clear space then try again
- Download failed, check your connection is stable and try again
- App may be over 50 MB, with download blocked while not connected to Wi-Fi
- Your device UDID isn't included in the provisioning profile: for non-enterprise apps your device must be explicitly included in the provisioning profile, contact the developer to resolve
- The build is incorrectly signed or has broken entitlements: the developer must resolve

### After tapping "Install" nothing happens

This may occur for a number of reasons:

- iOS version is not compatible with this build: you should see the supported iOS version on the download page
- Download failed, check your connection is stable and try again
- Your device UDID isn't included in the provisioning profile: for non-enterprise apps your device must be explicitly included in the provisioning profile, contact the developer to resolve
- The build is incorrectly signed or has broken entitlements: the developer must resolve
- If you have previously installed this app from a different source and there is a version conflict, the installation may silently fail. Uninstall the previous version then try again

If issues persist, it is likely the app has not been properly prepared for your device - contact the developer to resolve.
