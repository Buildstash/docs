<Callout>
  This feature is available to users on our [Pro plan](https://buildstash.com/pricing) and up.
</Callout>

## Introduction

When you create a new application, by default you can upload builds into our hosted cloud storage. The amount of hosted storage you are provided varies based on your [subscription plan](https://buildstash.com/pricing).

If you prefer, you can instead connect self-hosted storage buckets to store your builds. Right now we support S3-compatible storage buckets, with documented support for [AWS S3](/integrations/storage/aws-s3) and [Cloudflare R2](/integrations/storage/cloudflare-r2).

## Pre-requisites

To use a self-hosted storage bucket for your application, you need to start with an application with no builds yet uploaded. So, it is recommended to set this up immediately after creating a new application, if you prefer to use custom storage. This option will also become available however for any application with no builds, including where any previous builds have been deleted.

<Callout title="Migrate existing builds">
  We don't yet have a migration tool to move existing application builds over from a hosted to self-hosted bucket. If you wish to move an application to self-hosted, it is advised to create a new application and begin storing new builds from that point onwards in your self-hosted bucket.

## Connecting custom storage

To connect a custom storage bucket, go to your application settings > Storage > Configure storage.
