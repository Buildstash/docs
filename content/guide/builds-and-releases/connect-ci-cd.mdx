description: Automate upload from your CI/CD pipeline to Buildstash
---

## Introduction

If you use a CI/CD platform or build automation tool of some kind, it's easy to automate uploads of your build artifacts.

From your CI/CD pipeline you can:

- Upload the built binaries, as well as optional associated metadata files
- Set build versioning
- Determine what stream a build should be sent into
- Attach labels
- And pass in many more optional metadata fields..

## Available CI/CD integrations

We offer a wide range of ready-made integrations for popular CI/CD platforms. You can view a full list in our [Integrations Directory](/integrations), or build your own using our [API](/api).

All of our integrations are open source, and can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/buildstash). If you'd like to see an integration we don't have yet, [request it](https://support.buildstash.com/roadmap), or even use an [existing integration](https://github.com/Buildstash/upload-to-buildstash) as a template to build your own!

## Generate an application API token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create API token">
    <strong>Create API token</strong>

    In your application settings, navigate to the “Connections” tab, and select “New Token”.

    ![Create application token](https://media.buildstash.com/docs/guide/connect-ci-cd/create_5e7bab07467281fee4846c2d031233d1.png)

    Give the token a name to help you remember where it's being used.
  </Step>
  <br />
  <Step title="Safely store for use">
    <strong>Safely store for use</strong>

    Your new API token will be shown.

    ![Note the created token](https://media.buildstash.com/docs/guide/connect-ci-cd/note_ff59d991e66c7ec63bf623150d9b6bcb.png)

    Note this is the only time the token will be shown, so be careful to record it securely (like in a password manager).
