description: Store related metadata files with your builds

## Introduction

You can store additional metadata files with your builds, separate to the core binary files.

These may include build logs, test results, SBOMs, or any other metadata files which are relevant to your workflow.

## Supported metadata file formats

Metadata artifact files can be uploaded in an [array of different formats](/api/data/metadata-filetypes), up to 5 MB in filesize.

## Uploading metadata artifacts

You can upload metadata artifacts via the web interface, by first uploading a build, and then opening the build info modal.

You can also upload metadata artifacts [via CI/CD integrations](/builds-and-releases/connect-ci-cd), allowing you to upload files provided as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
