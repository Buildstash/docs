## Introduction

You can use automations to trigger actions on application events, such as when a build is uploaded, or when a release is created.

This feature can be used to easily notify external services of actions within your workspace, passing relevant build data, perhaps allowing further actions to be triggered - such as a custom deployment workflow.

## Supported events

You can configure automations to trigger on the following events:

| Event Name             | Description                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `build.created`        | New build uploaded                             |
| `build.created.stream` | Build created in a specific stream             |
| `build.moved`          | Build moved to a different stream (any stream) |
| `build.moved.stream`   | Build moved into a specified stream            |
| `build.label.added`    | Label added to build (new or existing)         |
| `release.created`      | Release created                                |
| `release.updated`      | Release updated - builds added or removed      |
