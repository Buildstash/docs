## Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security feature that adds an additional layer of protection to your account. We strongly advise you set this up for improved security.

We use OTP (one-time password) based 2FA, which can be configured via any standard 2FA app, such as [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) (cross-platform), [2FAS Auth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/2fa-authenticator-2fas/id1217793794) (cross-platform, recommended on iOS), or [Aegis](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beemdevelopment.aegis) (Android via Google Play or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.beemdevelopment.aegis/)).

## Single sign-on

You may configure single sign-on access to your account - if a workspace you are a member of has made an enterprise SSO option available.
