## Basic setup, and custom subdomain

On sign up you'll be prompted to give your workspace a name, and upload a logo. This will be used in various places through the app, including on views your users may see - such as share links and distribution groups.

While it's optional, it's also advised to choose a workspace subdomain now. This will let you share download links with your custom subdomain.

## Create your first application

You'll want to begin by creating your first _Application_. In Buildstash, all builds and releases are grouped under an application.

Applications can contain builds targeting multiple platforms (up to 12 platforms per application, to provide plenty flexibility).

![Create application](https://media.buildstash.com/docs/guide/get-setup/02_create_app.png)

Once you've setup your first application, you can customize settings as preferred - including [streams](/builds-and-releases/streams) and [labels](/builds-and-releases/labels) for your workflow.

While Buildstash provides integrated storage as [part of your plan](https://buildstash.com/pricing), if you prefer to self-hosted your build files, you'll want to [setup custom storage](/integrations/storage/aws-s3) now.

## Upload your first build

You're then ready to upload your first build!

  alt="Upload build"
  width={550}
  height={800}
  sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 50vw"
/>

You can do this via the [web uploader](/builds-and-releases/uploading-via-web), but if you have a CI/CD pipeline - this would be a great time to [setup an integration](/builds-and-releases/connect-ci-cd), and automate sending in your builds.

## Invite your team

For internal collaborators - anyone you wish to have access to upload and manage builds - you'll want to invite them into your workspace.
