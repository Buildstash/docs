<Update label="2025-02-23" description="v0.1.1">
  We now have improved iOS and Android build processing and distribution functionality.

  When you upload an Android App Bundle (.aab) file, we will now auto-generate a universal Android Package (.apk) allowing direct install to device.

  iOS builds which are signed for in-house distribution (ad-hoc or enterprise) and shared in your workspace or via created share links, will now guide the user through direct install with a helpful wizard.

  And on both platforms we now display additional data extracted from the package in the "build info" panel.
