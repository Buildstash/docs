    The redirect URI must use your workspace's custom subdomain. The format must be:

    <Check>
      https://\{SUBDOMAIN}.buildstash.com/jumpcloud/callback
    </Check>

    You must set "Client Authentication Type" to "Client Secret Post".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set scopes">
    Select both "Email" and "Profile" user standard scopes.

    You can then click "Activate".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy client ID and secret">
    Copy the credentials presented. The secret will not be displayed again - so copy and store it securely, such as in a password manager.
