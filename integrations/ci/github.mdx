If you're using GitHub Actions sending your build artifacts into Buildstash is easy.

## Create your application API token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create API token">
    In your application settings, navigate to the "Connections" tab, and select "New Token".

    ![](/SCR-20250112-mmio.png)Call the token anything you like - ideally something that helps you remember where it's being used.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Safely store for use">
    Your new API token will be shown.

    Note this is the only time the token will be shown, so be careful to record it securely (like in a password manager).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add Buildstash action to your workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Buildstash action">
    Go to the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/buildstash" target="_blank">Buildstash action page on the GitHub Marketplace</a>.&#x20;

    ![](/SCR-20250112-mnph.png)

    You can copy and paste the provided code into your workflow yaml script.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add API key to your 'Actions secrets' for the repository">
    Take the Buildstash API key you created in the step above, and store it as a "Actions" secret.

    Note, as you'll be using an application-specific Buildstash API key (required to upload builds for particular app) you likely want to store this secret on your GitHub repository level, rather than workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tweak input values accordingly">
    Update the action inputs to pass in your project and run specific values.

    See below for more detail on each input.
  </Step>

  <Step title="See your builds appear in Buildstash!">

    Successful GitHub Actions runs will now be sending your builds into Buildstash. Welcome to artifact management actually designed for apps.
