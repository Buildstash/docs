When uploading a build to Buildstash via the API or CI/CD integration, the "platform" field should be set to the accompanying "identifier" for the targeted platform.

When attaching supported architectures to a build, you can see the supported architecture identifiers in the table above. Find a full list of supported architectures [here](/api-reference/data/architectures).
