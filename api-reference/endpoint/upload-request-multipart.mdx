title: "Request Multipart Upload Part"
description: "Request a presigned URL for a specific part of a multipart upload"
method: "POST"
endpoint: "/upload/request/multipart"
---

<Note>
  This endpoint is used for multipart uploads of files larger than 5GB. You must call this endpoint for each part of the file.
</Note>

## Overview

The multipart upload request endpoint is used to get presigned URLs for individual parts of a large file upload. This is required for files larger than 5GB.

## Request Body

<ParamField body="pending_upload_id" type="string" required>
  The pending upload ID returned from the initial `/upload/request` call
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="part_number" type="integer" required>
  The part number (1-based) for this chunk of the file
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="content_length" type="integer" required>
  The size of this part in bytes
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseExample>
  <ResponseExampleBody>
```json
{
  "part_presigned_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/presigned-url-for-part-1"
}
```
  </ResponseExampleBody>
</ResponseExample>

## Multipart Upload Process

1. **Initial Request**: Call `/upload/request` to get upload information
2. **For Each Part**: 
   - Calculate the byte range for this part
   - Call `/upload/request/multipart` with the part number and size
   - Upload the part to the returned presigned URL
   - Save the ETag from the upload response
3. **Complete Upload**: Call `/upload/verify` with all ETags

## Example Usage

<CodeGroup>

```bash Request Part 1
curl -X POST https://app.buildstash.com/api/v1/upload/request/multipart \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pending_upload_id": "upload_123456789",
    "part_number": 1,
    "content_length": 104857600
  }'
```

```bash Upload Part 1
curl -X PUT "https://s3.amazonaws.com/presigned-url-for-part-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
  -H "Content-Length: 104857600" \
  --data-binary @part1.bin
```

</CodeGroup>

## Part Size Calculation

For a file of size `total_size` with `num_parts` parts:

- **Part Size**: `part_size = total_size / num_parts`
- **Last Part**: May be smaller than other parts
- **Byte Ranges**: 
  - Part 1: `0` to `part_size - 1`
  - Part 2: `part_size` to `2 * part_size - 1`
  - Part N: `(N-1) * part_size` to `min(N * part_size - 1, total_size - 1)`

## Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid part number or content length
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing API key
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid pending upload ID

## Important Notes

- Part numbers must be sequential starting from 1
- Each part must be uploaded exactly once
- The ETag from each upload must be saved for the final verification step
- Parts can be uploaded in parallel for better performance
- If a part upload fails, you can retry uploading to the same presigned URL
