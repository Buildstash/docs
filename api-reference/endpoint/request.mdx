  This endpoint initiates the build upload process by requesting presigned URLs. The response will indicate whether single-part or multipart upload is possible. Multipart is always required for files larger than 5GB.

## Overview

The upload request endpoint is the first step in uploading a new build.

It provides all key build information, and returns a presigned URL for direct upload or multipart upload information for larger files.
