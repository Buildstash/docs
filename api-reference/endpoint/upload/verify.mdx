## Overview

The upload verification endpoint is the final step in the build upload process, for both single part and multipart uploads. It verifies that all parts have been successfully uploaded, and creates the final build record in Buildstash.

## Important Notes

- The verification step is required for both single part and multipart uploads
- For multipart uploads, all parts must be included in the `multipart_chunks` array
- ETags must match exactly what was returned from the upload requests
- Once verified, the upload cannot be modified
- The build may take some time to process, indicated by `pending_processing: true`
