## Overview

This endpoint is used to request a presigned URL for each individual part of a multipart file upload.

### Notes

- Part numbers must be sequential starting from 1
- Each part must be uploaded exactly once
- The ETag from each upload must be saved for the final verification step
- Parts can be uploaded in parallel for better performance
- If a part upload fails, you can retry uploading to the same presigned URL
