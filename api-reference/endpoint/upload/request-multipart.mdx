<Note>
  This endpoint is only needed for multipart uploads, including any files larger than 5GB.
</Note>

## Overview

This endpoint is used to request a presigned URL for each individual part of a multipart file upload. This is required for files larger than 5GB, and optional for smaller files.

## Part Size Calculation

For a file of size `total_size` with `num_parts` parts:

- **Part Size**: `part_size = total_size / num_parts`
- **Last Part**: May be smaller than other parts
- **Byte Ranges**: 
  - Part 1: `0` to `part_size - 1`
  - Part 2: `part_size` to `2 * part_size - 1`
  - Part N: `(N-1) * part_size` to `min(N * part_size - 1, total_size - 1)`

## Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid part number or content length
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing API key
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid pending upload ID

## Important Notes

- Part numbers must be sequential starting from 1
- Each part must be uploaded exactly once
- The ETag from each upload must be saved for the final verification step
- Parts can be uploaded in parallel for better performance
- If a part upload fails, you can retry uploading to the same presigned URL
