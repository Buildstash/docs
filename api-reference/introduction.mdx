<Note>
  Our API is currently in a pre-release state. We will selectively document key endpoints here you can take advantage of ahead of a full release in Q3 2025.
</Note>

## Authentication

Upload API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Include your application-specific API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
