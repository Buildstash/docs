## Welcome

Buildstash provides a powerful API for uploading files and managing builds. The API supports both single part uploads for smaller files and multipart uploads for files larger than 5GB.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Upload Methods

### Single Part Upload
For files smaller than 5GB, use the single part upload flow:

1. **Request Upload** - Call `/upload/request` to get a presigned URL
2. **Upload File** - Upload directly to the presigned URL
3. **Verify Upload** - Call `/upload/verify` to complete the process

### Multipart Upload
For files larger than 5GB, use the multipart upload flow:

1. **Request Upload** - Call `/upload/request` to get multipart information
2. **Request Parts** - Call `/upload/request/multipart` for each part
3. **Upload Parts** - Upload each part to its presigned URL
4. **Verify Upload** - Call `/upload/verify` with all ETags
